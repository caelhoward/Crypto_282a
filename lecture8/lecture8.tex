\section{Interactive Proofs vs. Argument Schemes in Zero-Knowledge}
\subsection{Computational/Perfect Security and Binding}
We have the following definition of \textbf{Hiding}, and \textbf{Binding} in commitment schemes.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hiding:} How well, for commitment $commit(b)$, the scheme hides $b$ from the receiver $R$. That is, how difficult it is for $R$ to determine the value of $b$ given $commit(b)$.
    \item \textbf{Binding:} How difficult, for commitment $commit(b)$, it is for the Commiter $C$ to decommit to a values $b' \neq b$ after sending $commit(b)$.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Statistically Binding, Computationally Hiding}
Recall the scheme where the Commiter $C$ sends commitment:
$$commit(b) = (b\ \oplus <x,r>, f(x), r>$$
With one way permutation $f$ and decommits with $x$. Firstly, since $f$ is a permutation, only one $x$ can decommit the $f(x)$ value so the commitment is \textbf{perfectly binding}. Furthermore, we demonstrated that there is no PPT adversary that can sucessfully predict $<x,r>$ with non-negligible probability, and therefore the scheme is \textbf{computationally binding}.
\subsubsection{Computationally Binding, Statistically Hiding}
First we define the notion of a \textbf{Claw-Free Pair} $(f_1,f_2)$ which are a pair of 1-way permutations s.t. no polytime machine can find $x_0,x_1$ such that $f_(x_0) = f_(x_1)$.
\vspace{1em}

With this, we can construct the following commitment scheme that is \textbf{Perfectly hiding} and \textbf{Computationally Binding}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Commiter $C$ selects random $x \overset{\$}{\leftarrow} X$ and commitment $f_b(x)$.
    \item Decommit by sending $x$, where receiver can calculate the decommitment by testing whether $f_1/f_0 = f_b(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
This scheme is clearly computationally binding since a PPT commiter cannot find two values $x_0,x_1$ such that $f_0(x_0) = f_1(x_1)$. Furthermore, since it relies on the fact that $C$ is weak, the receiver $R$ cannot distinguish whether $f_b(x)$ was derived from $f_0(x_0)$ or $f_1(x_1)$, and therefore cannot determine the commitment.
\vspace{1em}

This type of commitment is called a Zero Knowledge Argument opposed to a proof since an infinitely powerful prover could cheat. However, in practice it is very useful as even a infinitely powerful \textit{eavesdropper} cannot successfuly decommit $C$'s commitment before $C$ does.

\subsubsection{Impossibiliy of Perfect Hiding and Binding}
It is impossible for a scheme to be both perfectly hiding and binding. Consider a commitment scheme between an infinitely powerful commiter $C$ and receiver $R$ that achieves both perfect hiding and binding. Perfect binding implies that once $C$ chooses $b$, $decommit(commit(b)) = b$. Since the receiver is infinitely powerful, it can enumerate through all possible inputs of the commitment scheme until it finds one that generates the same value as $commit(b)$, and can therefore determine $b$, demonstrating that the scheme cannot be perfectly hiding.

\section{Pseudo Random Generators}
A pseudo random generator $G$ takes small seed $s$ and outputs string $G(s)$ that is of length $Q(|s|)$ for some polynomial $Q$. The notion of \textbf{Indistinguishability} means that two strings $r \overset{\$}{\leftarrow} \{0,1\}^{Q(|x|)}$ and $G(s)$ with $s \overset{\$}{\leftarrow} \{0,1\}$ are Indistinguishabile by any PPT adversary $A$. We have a new notion of \textbf{Next-Bit Security} as follows:
\vspace{1em}

\subsection{Next-Bit Security of a PRG [Blum, Micali]]}
A PRG is \textbf{Next-Bit secure} if, given a stream of polynomially many bits generated from $PRG(s) = b_0b_1...b_{poly}$, no PPT adversary, given $b_0,...,b_{i-1}$ can predict $b_i$ with probability $\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon(poly)$.

\subsubsection{Next-Bit secure PRG}
We define the PRG as follows given 1 way permutation $f$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $G$ selects a random $r$ and seed $x_0$ to generate a string of length $m + 2n$.
    \item Firstly, for we generate $m$ bits in the following manner. For $i=1,...,m$, $x_i = f(x_{i-1})$ and $d_i = <x_i, r>$. Then the PRG outputs $x_m | r | d_m,d_{m-1},...,d_{1}$.
\end{enumerate}
To demonstrate that this scheme is secure, we must argue that that any adversary that can determine $b_i$ given $b_{1},...,b_{i-1}$ with non-negligible advantage can sucessfully invert $f$ with non-negligible probability. Firstly, recall that if an adversary $A$ exists that can successfully predict $<x,r>$ given $(f(x),r)$, then we can construct an $A'$ that can successfuly invert $f$ with non-negligible probability. Thus, we will show that the existence of an adversary that has advantage over guessing $b_i$ for some $i$ has an advantage in guessing $(f(x),r)$. The adversary $A$, given oracle access to $A_G$, which predicts $b_i$, does the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A$ receives $(f(x'), r)$ and has to output $<x',r>$ with non-negligible probability, firstly, it generates the string as done above using $r$. Then, for random $x_i$, it replaces it with $f(x')$ and computes the remainder of the bits according the the algorithm.
    \item Now, it sequentially passing the bits $b_1,...,b_{m+2n}$ to $A_G$ until $A_G$ outputs $b_i$. If $i$ was the location where the initial $x$ was swapped for $f(x')$, then $A$ outputs $A_G$'s guess.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Demonstrating Advantage}:
\vspace{1em}

Firstly, observe that the last $2n$ bits of the $PRG$ are completely random. Since $f$ is a permutation $Pr[x_m = x_m] = \frac{1}{2^n}$. Furthermore, since $r$ is also random it cannot predict any $b_i$ for $i=1,...,2n$ with probability greater than $1/2$.
\vspace{1em}

For the last $m$ bits of $G$, there must be some $i$ where $A_G$ can predict $b_i$ with non-negligible probability. If that location is exactly where we replaced $<x_i,r>$ with $<x',r>$, then the $A$'s advantage of guessing $<x',r>$ is $\frac{1}{m} \cdot \epsilon(n)$ where $\epsilon(n)$ is $A_G$'s advantage of predicting the next bit of the PRG, which is still a non-negligible advantage.
\vspace{1em}

To demonstrate why we can simply replace a random $<x_i,r>$ with\\$<x',r>$, consider any honestly generated sequence $x_m|r|b_1,...,b_m$. Then $A_G$ must have an advantage on guessing some $b_i$. Since $b_i = <x_i, r>$, we can guarantee that $A$ has a non-negligible advantage on $(f(x_i),r)$ since we can construct the first $2n + i$ bits as described above.
\vspace{1em}

\subsection{Equivalence of Indistinguishability and Next-Bit Security}
We need to show that \textbf{Indistinguishability $\Longleftrightarrow$ Next Bit Security}. Direction that \textbf{Indistinguishability $\Longrightarrow$ Next-Bit Security}. To demonstrate this we show that if we have an adversary that can guess the next bit of $G(s)$, then there exists adversary that can distinguish $G(s)$ and random string $r$. This is simply done by feeding the adversary $A$ the bits of $G(s)/r$ and outputting $1$ if it guesses a bit correctly and $0$ if it gets it wrong.

\subsubsection{Next-Bit Security $\Longrightarrow$ Indistinguishability}
We demonstrate that if there exists an adversary $A$ that can distinguish $G(s)$ from $r$ with non-negligible probability, then it can guess the next-bit of a stream of either $r$ or $G(s)$ with non-negligible probability. We once again use the hybrid argument as follows, since:
$$|Pr[A(G(s))=1] - Pr[A(r)=1]| = \epsilon(n)$$
There must be some $i$ where, $X_i=PRG(S)_1,...,PRG(S)_i,r_{i+1},...,r_n$:
$$|Pr[A(X_{i-1})=1]-Pr[A(X_{i})=1]| \geq \frac{\epsilon(n)}{m}$$
We design $A'$, which guesses bit $i$ from $G(S)$ as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Receive the first $i-1$ bits and construct $X=b_1,...b_{i-1}$.
    \item Guess bit $b_{i}$ as $b'$ and generate $n-i$ random bits $r$.
    \item If $A(b_1,...,b_{i-1},b',r_{i+1},...r_n)=1$ output guess $b'$, else $1-b'$
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Analysis:} To argue that it guesses $b_i$ with non-negligible probability, we first simplify $\epsilon(n)/m$ to $\epsilon(n)$ and get the following:
\begin{align*}
    Pr[A'(b_1...b_{i-1})=b_i] &= Pr[b'=b_i] \cdot Pr[A(X_{i}) = 1]\\
    &+ Pr[b'=1-b_1] \cdot Pr[A(b_1...b_{i-1}\hat{b_i}r_{i+1}...r_n)=0]\\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \epsilon(n) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot q
\end{align*}
Before solving for $q$, the first part of the above probability is the probability that the guessed $b'$ is actually $b_i$ times the probability $A$ outputs $1$. We say that $P_i = Pr[A(X_i) = 1]$ To solve for $q$, we need to find out:
\begin{align*}
    Pr[A(X_{i-1})=1] &= Pr[A(b_1..b_{i-1}b_iR) = 1] \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\cdot Pr[A(b_1...b_{i-1}\overline{b_i}R) = 1]\\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \cdot P_i + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (1-q)\\
    q &= P_{i} + 1 - 2 \cdot P_{i-1}
\end{align*}
Plugging $q$ back into the orginal equation we get:
\begin{align*}
    = &\frac{1}{2} \cdot P_i + \frac{1}{2} \cdot q\\
    & \frac{1}{2}(2P_i+1-2p_{i-1})\\
    &\geq \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon(n)
\end{align*}
